<p><img src="images/ouilala.jpg" align="right" alt="" /><strong>There are a lot of ways to strengthen the size and length of an erection, and one of the better ways out there is definitely going to be using the oils, gels and creams.</strong> The reason for this is that many men are simply not willing to take a pill, or they have trouble doing so due to factors like a strong gag reflex or a sensitive stomach that does not handle pill formulas of any kind very well. Still, these men need a solution that is going to give them the penis performance they need to please the woman they are getting into bed with. </p><p>
With today's creams, oils and gels you can simply apply the solution directly to your penis and begin to get results instantly. <strong>This is the perfect solution for those want to be able to test out a product and make sure it works, because you will know right away just how effective these products are.</strong> While there are some penis oils out there that are not at all effective, we have selected the top 3 for you so you can make an informed decision based on the facts and get rock hard erections right away. </p><h3>Let's take a look:</h3>
<h2>
Vigrx Oil 
</h2>
<a href="#"><img src="images/vigrlogo.jpg" align="left" alt="" class="Plogo" /></a>
<div class="clr"></div>
<p>
<span class="emp">This is by far and away the strongest product on the market today.</span> This oil solution is from the makers of the VigRX high performance penis pills, but it is able to deliver the goods directly through the skin. This helps generate a totally rigid penis in just a few moments. That means you can be ready to please her right after you apply the VigRX oil. Even better, she can put it on for you since it is a non-greasy formula that does not have any strange scents or chemicals involved.
</p>
<a href="#"><img src="images/oilv.jpg" align="left" alt="" class="Plogo"  /></a>
<p>
<strong>By making use of a variety of powerful herbs that are known to increase blood flow, testosterone and other important elements of strong sexual function in men, the VigRX oil gives you a boost without a pill.</strong> It works perfectly with condoms and she can even give you oral sex with no problems at all since there's nothing harmful in the oil. If you struggle with premature ejaculation, this oil can be a huge help, as well. </p><p>
For these reasons alone, in addition to the powerful results it offers in instant erections, VigRX oil is a top choice.
</p>

</h2>

<div class="clr"></div>
<a href="#"><img src="images/prog.jpg" align="right" alt="" class="Plogo"  /></a>
<p>
With a texture that is more comparable to standard sex lubes for women that you may have already encountered, <span class="emp">the ProSolution Gel can give you an instant erection only 60 seconds after applying it. This is a definite plus for those who want to be able to get ready fast.</span> Many women will prefer this texture because it tends to be more familiar to them, but gel or oil is a personal choice, in the end.
</p><div class="clr"></div><p>
<strong>This ProSolution Gel will work with condoms and it works directly on the flow of blood and increasing sexual stamina to eliminate premature ejaculation.</strong> If you are looking for a product that can give you stiffness right away, this is definitely a great choice. </p><h2>
MaxODerm
 </h2>
<a href="#"><img src="images/maxologo.jpg" align="left" alt="" class="Plogo" /></a>
<div class="clr"></div>
<a href="#"><img src="images/maxo.jpg" align="right" alt="" class="Plogo"  /></a>
<p>
<span class="emp">Out of the products on this list, MaxODerm is the one that emphasizes more direct exercising of the penis along with the use of their Maxoderm System.</span> This is encouragement to make sure that you engage in regular masturbation to exercise all of the muscles in the penis to bring about top performance. For some men, this is a turn off and they may not be comfortable using the product in that way. For those who do want to be able to use it to not only obtain an instant erection for her, but to build their own sexual stamina, this can be a great choice as well.

          <h2>Is Size Truly Important to a Man's Performance?</h2>
<p>There is a lot of talk about the size of our penises - both about those who are well endowed and those who are facing insufficient firepower. The fact is, having a giant penis is not really the name of the game here. What is truly important is making sure that you feel confident with your penis and are getting the performance that you want as often as possible. 
</p><p>
<span class="emp">Why worry about being small when there are solutions that can help you? Why worry about taking dangerous chemical pills when there are herbal supplements that can get the job done in a healthy way? </span>
</p><p>
For many men, having a small penis can be a burden in more ways than just the physical. Sure, it can make entering a woman more awkward and nerve wracking, but it can also lead to communication problems. You see, when a man is dealing with feeling that he is not the right size in comparison to a woman's expectations, he is often not going to be able to express that. A woman who likes him will kindly reassure him that he's "just fine" or that his penis is "a nice size", but he is going to be able to tell that <strong>she is making do instead of getting what she might want most.</strong> Even women who are willing to do their best to enjoy their lover's small penis may experience less enthusiasm in bed regardless of whether or not they want to. </p><p>
<img src="images/smallguy.jpg" alt="" width="277" height="183" align="right" />In the past, living with a penis that did not perform the way you wanted it to would have been your only option, unless you came from a culture that knew the secrets of the local herbs that could help you. That's why <strong>a lot of men down through the ages have suffered in silence.</strong></p><p>
<strong>Let that be a thing of the past - take control of your own sexuality </strong>the way that today's women can, thanks to sexual lubes that help them when they aren't able to produce the wetness they want. It isn't their fault they battle with bodily issues any more than it is your fault you experience troubles in bed. </p>
<h3>Today, your options are vast.</h3> <p>You can choose pills with highly researched ingredients specially formulated to give you a bigger penis, longer lasting erections, greater stamina and even more semen when you ejaculate. Chances are good that you already knew this, what you might not know is that you have even more options. Today there are patches you can wear that give you these same results, as well as gels, creams and oils you can apply directly to your penis for an instant erection when you need to please her right away. There are exercise routines you can do in the privacy of your own home, as well. 
</p><p>
Look, here's the bottom line: you don't have to live with a sex life you don't love. 
</p><p>
Explore your options and you will find a solution that's right for you. You deserve to be happy and so does any woman you choose to share a sexual experience with. A fulfilling sex life is not something for special people; anyone willing to do what it takes can enjoy sex to the fullest.
